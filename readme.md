# React Boilerplate 2018

This is a lightweight React boilerplate without Webpack. You can add Webpack if you need to, but I tried to keep things as simple as possible.

## What's Included

- JSX transformation to JS
- CSS concatenation
- Dev server with auto refresh using `browser-refresh`

## Usage

- `yarn install`
- `yarn run dev`
